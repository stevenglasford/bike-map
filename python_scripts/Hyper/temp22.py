You‚Äôre absolutely right. Let me search through your matcher51.py script more carefully to find the actual structure and classes you‚Äôre using.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

Perfect! Now I can see the exact structure of your script. Your matcher51.py has:

1. **`TurboAdvancedGPSProcessor`** class with `_process_single_gpx_turbo()` method
1. **`_extract_enhanced_gps_features_turbo()`** method for GPS features
1. Video processing that happens before GPS processing in `main()`

The problem is that your **environmental feature extraction functions are defined but not called** in the actual processing pipeline. Here‚Äôs exactly where to make the changes:

## **Step-by-Step Integration Instructions**

### **Step 1: Find and Enhance GPS Processing**

In your `TurboAdvancedGPSProcessor` class, find the `_extract_enhanced_gps_features_turbo()` method and **modify it** to include environmental features:

```python
@staticmethod
def _extract_enhanced_gps_features_turbo(df: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:
    """ENHANCED: Extract GPS features WITH environmental features"""
    try:
        # Your existing GPS feature extraction code (keep all of it)
        features = {}
        
        # ... (keep all your existing feature extraction code) ...
        
        # üÜï ADD THIS: Extract environmental GPS features
        if len(df) >= 3:
            env_processor = EnhancedEnvironmentalProcessor(None)  # Create processor
            
            # Extract enhanced environmental features
            env_features = env_processor.extract_enhanced_gps_environmental_features(df)
            features.update(env_features)
            
            logger.debug(f"üóª Added {len(env_features)} environmental GPS features")
        
        return features
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Enhanced GPS feature extraction failed: {e}")
        return {}
```

### **Step 2: Find and Enhance Video Processing**

Look for your video processing in the `main()` function. Find where videos are processed (before the GPS processing section) and locate the video processor. You need to find something like:

```python
# Look for this pattern in your main() function:
video_processor = SomeVideoProcessor(config)  # Find this line
video_features = video_processor.process_videos(video_files)  # Find this line
```

Then **modify the video processing method** to include environmental features. Find the method that processes individual videos and enhance it:

```python
def process_single_video(self, video_path: str) -> Dict:
    """Enhanced video processing WITH environmental features"""
    try:
        # Your existing video processing code (keep all of it)
        features = {}
        frames = []
        
        # ... (keep all your existing video feature extraction) ...
        
        # üÜï ADD THIS: Extract environmental video features
        if frames:  # If you successfully extracted frames
            env_processor = EnhancedEnvironmentalProcessor(self.config)
            
            # Extract lighting features
            lighting_features = env_processor._extract_lighting_features(frames)
            features.update(lighting_features)
            
            # Extract scene complexity features
            complexity_features = env_processor._extract_scene_complexity_features(frames)
            features.update(complexity_features)
            
            # Extract camera stability features  
            stability_features = env_processor._extract_stability_features(frames)
            features.update(stability_features)
            
            logger.debug(f"üåø Added {len(lighting_features + complexity_features + stability_features)} environmental video features")
        
        return {
            'features': features,
            'frames': frames  # Keep frames for further processing
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Enhanced video processing failed for {video_path}: {e}")
        return {}
```

### **Step 3: Enhance the Correlation Engine**

Find your correlation computation in the main processing section (after both video and GPS features are extracted). Look for where correlations are computed and **modify it** to use environmental features:

```python
# In your main correlation processing section, find where similarity is computed:

# Replace the existing correlation computation with:
def compute_enhanced_correlation(video_features, gps_features):
    """Enhanced correlation with environmental features"""
    try:
        # Initialize enhanced processor
        enhanced_processor = UltraEnhancedCorrelationProcessor(config)
        
        # Separate traditional and environmental features
        video_traditional = {k: v for k, v in video_features.items() 
                           if not any(term in k.lower() for term in 
                                    ['lighting', 'brightness', 'vegetation', 'urban', 'horizon', 'complexity'])}
        
        video_environmental = {k: v for k, v in video_features.items() 
                             if any(term in k.lower() for term in 
                                  ['lighting', 'brightness', 'vegetation', 'urban', 'horizon', 'complexity'])}
        
        gps_traditional = {k: v for k, v in gps_features.items() 
                          if not any(term in k.lower() for term in 
                                   ['elevation', 'terrain', 'time_of_day', 'route_complexity'])}
        
        gps_environmental = {k: v for k, v in gps_features.items() 
                           if any(term in k.lower() for term in 
                                ['elevation', 'terrain', 'time_of_day', 'route_complexity'])}
        
        # Compute enhanced correlation
        correlation_result = enhanced_processor.compute_ultra_enhanced_correlation(
            video_features=video_traditional,
            gps_features=gps_traditional, 
            video_env_features=video_environmental,
            gps_env_features=gps_environmental
        )
        
        return correlation_result
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Enhanced correlation failed: {e}")
        return {'combined': 0.0, 'quality': 'failed'}
```

### **Step 4: Test the Integration**

After making these changes, **run your script** and look for these new log messages:

```
üóª Added X environmental GPS features
üåø Added Y environmental video features  
üîó Active correlations: ['motion_dynamics', 'lighting_time_correlation', 'elevation_visual_correlation', ...]
```

### **Step 5: Quick Diagnostic**

Add this diagnostic function to verify environmental features are working:

```python
def diagnose_environmental_features(video_features, gps_features):
    """Diagnostic to verify environmental features are extracted"""
    
    # Check video environmental features
    video_env_count = len([k for k in video_features.keys() if any(term in k.lower() for term in 
                          ['lighting', 'brightness', 'vegetation', 'urban', 'horizon', 'complexity'])])
    
    # Check GPS environmental features  
    gps_env_count = len([k for k in gps_features.keys() if any(term in k.lower() for term in
                        ['elevation', 'terrain', 'time_of_day', 'route_complexity'])])
    
    logger.info(f"üîç ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES DIAGNOSTIC:")
    logger.info(f"üìπ Video environmental features: {video_env_count}")
    logger.info(f"üó∫Ô∏è GPS environmental features: {gps_env_count}")
    
    if video_env_count == 0 and gps_env_count == 0:
        logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è NO ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES DETECTED!")
        logger.warning("   The new features are defined but not being extracted.")
        logger.warning("   Check the integration in _extract_enhanced_gps_features_turbo() and video processing.")
    else:
        logger.info(f"‚úÖ Environmental integration working: {video_env_count + gps_env_count} total features")

# Call this function after feature extraction in your main processing loop
```

The key is that you need to **modify the existing `_extract_enhanced_gps_features_turbo()` method** to include environmental features, and **find and modify your video processing method** to include environmental video features.

Can you find the `_extract_enhanced_gps_features_turbo()` method in your matcher51.py and the video processing method, then add the environmental feature extraction as shown above?‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
